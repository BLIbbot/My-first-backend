To run:

If you have cloned this repository and wish to run the project you must first create one or both of the following .env files,
.env.test && || .env.dev --please match the file name(s) exactly!

You can do this in the terminal with the following commands:

touch .env.dev
touch .env.dev

Alternativly you can utilise VScodes explorer by either pressing the new file button or right clicking in the location you wish to store these files (in this case it should be the root of the directory - this is the main project folder containing all sub folders relevent to the project) and then typing the apropriate file name into the input bar.

Inside these files you will only need one line:

PGDATABASE=nc_news       --for the .env.dev database 
PGDATABASE=nc_news_test  --for the .env.test database

After one or both of these files are succesfully created you are ready to run the project.
