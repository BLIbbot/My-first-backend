To run:

If you have cloned this repository and wish to run the project you must first create one or both of the following .env files,
.env.test && || .env.dev --please match the file name(s) exactly!

You can do this in the terminal with the following commands:

touch .env.dev
touch .env.dev

Alternativly you can utilise VScodes explorer by either pressing the new file button or right clicking in the location you wish to store these files (in this case it should be the root of the directory - this is the main project folder containing all sub folders relevent to the project) and then typing the apropriate file name into the input bar.

Inside these files you will only need one line:

PGDATABASE=nc_news       --for the .env.dev database 
PGDATABASE=nc_news_test  --for the .env.test database

After one or both of these files are succesfully created you are ready to run the project.

The README is targeted at people who will come to your repo (potentially from your CV or portfolio website). They'll want to see what you have created and try it out for themselves (not just to look at your code!). You should consider that the person reading your README is another developer, and so you can use high-level language to describe your project.
You should include:

Hosted version URL = 
Summary of what the project is:

Clear instructions of how to clone, install dependencies, seed local database, and run tests.
Information about how to create the two .env files.
